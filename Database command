table.there can be more then one foreign key in a table.

create table employee
(
empid number(5) primary key,
empname varchar2(30)
);


create table product
(
pid number(5) primary key,
pname varchar2(20),
empid number(5),
foreign key(empid) references employee(empid)
);

empid                empname
1001                 johan
1002                 Brown
1003                 Green
1004                 Lily

product:-
pid            pname         empid
101           Printer      1001
102           Scanner      1002
103           Plotter      1003
104           Laptop       1004
105           Projecter


Now insert records into employee table:-

insert into employee values(1001,'Johan');
insert into employee values(1002,'Brown');
insert into employee values(1003,'Green');
insert into employee values(1004,'lily');

Now insert record into product table:-

insert into product values(101,'Printer','1001');
insert into product values(102,'Scanner','1002');
insert into product values(103,'Plotter','1002');
insert into product values(104,'Laptop','1003');
insert into product(pid,pname) values(105,'projecter');

select empname from emp table and pname from product table based on empid:-

select empname,pname from employee,product where employee.empid=product.empid;

Interview Question:-

1.What is use of alter command? Haw many types we can use alter command?
2.What is difference between truncate and drop command?


Join Operation:-
------------------>if you want to select data from two table,then you can perform join
operation.For join operation atleast one field should be common in both tables.

select empname,pname from employee, product where employee.empid=product .empid;

Left join operation:-
---------------------->When you perform left join operation,then all record of left table 
are displayed and matching record of right table are displayed.

select empname,pname from employee left join product on employee.empid=product.empid;

Right join operation:-
----------------------->When you perform rigt join operation then all record of right table
are displayed are matching record of left table are displayed.

select empname,pname from employee right join product on employee.empid=product.empid;
