DBMS:-
------->DBMS stand for Database management system.DBMS is type of application softwere
which is used to manage,store and manipule the data in database management system.

Database user:-
---------------->End user are those users who use database through application,but 
they don't know about existance and structure of database.

Programmers:-
-------------->programmers are professionals who uses database in application development.

DBA:-
------>DBA is stand for Database Administrater .the DBA is responsible for creation of 
database and he/she also provide security in database.

SQL:-
------>SQL is stand for structure query language,it is used perform database operation.
Based on database operation SQL is categorized in four parts.


1.DDL(Data definition language).
2.DML(Data Manipulation language).
3.DCL(Data control language).
4.TCL(Transaction control language).

Commands of DDL:-
------------------->
1.Create:-
--------->the create commands is used to create a new database object.

2.Alter:-
----------->tha alter commands is used to modify database object.
 
3.Drop:-
------------>the drop commands is used to delete database object.

4.Truncate:-
-------------->truncate commands is used to delete all data from database object.

5.Backup:-
------------>Backup commands is used to take backup of database object.

6.Restore:-
------------>the restore commands is used to reconstruct database from its backup.


Commands of DML:-
------------------>

1.Insert:-
------------>the insert commands is used to insert data into database object.

2.Delete:-
----------->the delete commands is used to delete record from database object.

3.Update:-
------------>the update is used to modify record in database object.

4.Select:-
------------>the select commands is used to select records database object.

Commands of DCL:- 
------------------>

1.Grant:-
---------->the grant commands is used to give rights to database user.

2.Revoke:-
------------>the revoke commands is just  opposite to grant commands and this is use  
to take off rights from database user.

Commands of TCL:-
------------------>

1.Commit:-
----------->commit commands is use to save transaction.

2.Rollback:-
------------->Rollback commands is use to undo the transaction.
Primary key:-
-------------->Primary is a field in a table,which is use to identify each racord
uniquly.it is atomic and nat null.0

Join Operation:-
----------------->
if you want to select data from two tables then you can perform join operation .
for join operation atleast one field must be comman in both tables.

Foreign Key:-
------------->Foreign key is a field in table ,which works as primary key which onther
table.there can be more then one foreign key in a table.

Order by :-
------------>Order by is use to arrange record in sorteds order,

select * from empinfo order by empname;

for decending:-
---------------->
select * from empinfo order by empname desc;

SQL Operater:-
---------------->
>             greator than
<             less than
>=            gretor than or equal to 
<=            less than or equal to
=             equal to 
<>            not equal to 
like          like operater is for  pattern matching
in            in operater check value in given values
bitween       check value in given range.



1.select the racord with empid 1001.
select * from empinfo where empid=1001;

2.select those racords which have salary more than 50000.

select * from empinfo where salary>50000;

3.select those record with last name '%Singh'.


4.Select those record which name start with 'A'.

select * from empinfo where empname like 'A%';

SQL Function:-
---------------->
1.Sum():-
-------->sum()function is used to find sum of values of given column,


select sum(salary)from empinfo;

select sum(salary)"total Salary"from empinfo;

2.max():-
---------->max function find the maximum value of given column.

select max(salary)"Maximum Salary" from empinfo;


3.min():-
---------->the min()function find the minimum value of given column.

select min (salary)"Minimum Salary"from empinfo;

4.avg:-
---------->the avg function find the average value of given column.

select avg(salary)"average Salary"from empinfo;

5.count():-
------------>the count() function is used to count number.of rows in a table.

select count(*)"No.of rows"from empinfo;

Task:-
------->Select the record with maximum salary from empinfo,

Nested Query:-
---------------->if we use a query inside another query,then it is called nested query.


select * from empinfo where salary=(select max (salary)from empinfo);

Join Operation:-
------------------>if you want to select data from two table,then you can perform join
operation.For join operation atleast one field should be common in both tables.

select empname,pname from employee, product where employee.empid=product .empid;

Left join operation:-
---------------------->When you perform left join operation,then all record of left table 
are displayed and matching record of right table are displayed.

select empname,pname from employee left join product on employee.empid=product.empid;

Right join operation:-
----------------------->Whenyou perform right join operation then all record of right table
are displayed are matching record of left table are displayed.

select empname,pname from employee right join product on employee.empid=product.empid;


Composit key:-
---------------->if you make primary key by combining two more colums,than resultant key 
is called composit key or condidate key.


table name:-shipment

 create table shipment
(
s# varchar2(5),
p# varchar2(5),
qty number(5),
primary key(s#,p#)
);

How to createte table from given table?

create table empinfo2 as select empid,empname,salary from empinfo;
